Hey, I have dubmitted two files, Code1 is CNN with one hidden layer and Code2 has two hidden layers.
Submitted both of them because I have got 90+ accuracy from both of them while training but when I
submitted the predicted data on keggle, it showed only 50-60 accuracy. I have reported the same to
Ameer as well during the competition.

Instruction:
1. Just run it step by step.
2. 'Train.csv' and 'Test.csv' are the files provided by you.
3. At last, I added the accuracy for the data I used from 'train.csv' which I didn't use for training.
4. The prediction result is contained in 'predictions.csv' and 'predictions_1.csv' which are output
    files from Code1 and Code2 respectively.
