# Steps for Generating Required CSV File

### 1. Upload the train and test CSVs in the project environment and change their paths as required in the 2nd cell.
### 2. Run all the cells in order (Note: Run the 11th cell - 'Fitting the Model' 3 times. I set epochs=1 as a flexible option while experimenting.)
### 3. The required CSV file named 'final.csv' will be generated and uploaded.
